guma!?
@pixelmount xd
what about cho gath vs nasus
"gumayusi was in an iron ARAM game earlier today, pretty funny’s"
people really thinking garen is good into nasus lmao me I find this MU free LP on nasus
cancel e with an auto and r ur so skilled
bwipo my goat - hows it
why do garens always go ignite? Is he that good of an early brawler?
@taekwonbr lets see
@idlefarmer007 this nasus is gonna lose I can tell he is bad by his runes alone
@highELO_S1 yes level 2 good kill pressure
@highELO_S1 to gap close with nimbus clock
good synergy with his ult
"@highELO_S1 he has infinite sustain and doesnt spend mana, so he can always stay a little longer in lane"
gg top is over
nasus gonna die level 2 xd
@idlefarmer007 oh word thank you
bullying the dog DinoDance
d cane
how do u make it look so ez
@itsmario6969 ahh that makes sense
nasus already regretting queuing up
garen level 2 spike with ignite so nasty
"@dantiltas so just more frequent kill pressure over time, wouldnt need tp as often? makes sense"
"garen just walks in front of his tower, when dog want to enter garen just E and win lane"
thanks yall
!elo
balanced
Hey @bwipolol hope you’re doing well tonight!
