Chat has Mati ever worn white or any other color besides black?
"That is the ""screw this one guy in particular"" weapon"
"does this have ""omni-movement"""
@FreshPrince3223 blue
this is a game to keep us busy till BF6 :0
3 sicks in row.... you got a fever
:)
@Matimi0 If this game add ladders i think it could compate with BF6
@SpudBun yup
@PlotArmour_ Like Navy blue Kappa
so close to the sniper
Clearly you've never checked out Mat's OnlyGoths account
hawaiian shirt when?
chartreuse stream invoming
most my wardrobe is black and grey. i feel attacked
I think its so crazy people spend money on skins for these games because the skins go in the dumpster for the next game almost every year
charlie sheen bowling shirt vibes
@matimi0 i redeemed bowla :(
Do the holograms do anything for shooting them besides waste ammo?
I only saw you in Black always. Imagine Mati is actually dressed like Harry Styles irl
spending money on skins in a game is kinda cringe in general but at least for counter strike you can still use skins you bought 10 years ago
is that the voice actress for rampart on apex??
I swear to go Symmatra voice actor is in every game now
god
I dont think call of duty has looked so meh
its because you dont slide matt
I was told 15 years ago I looked good in green. I should buy a green shirt
a i m a s s i s t
"""report player"""
So how goes beta night 2?
Overwatch
Was that... Anjali Bhimani?
@MisterJab86 dude def was on MnK

@MisterJab86 scripts on PC Kappa
I watched the first vod quite a bit today
does this game have dabbing and unicorn farts
all correct chat
"Apex spidrman, overwatch, CoD, borderland 4"
tomo farts
grounded until season 2
give it two months
for now
"what kills me is they spent so much time and money to make the most mid game of 2025. i mean, its CoD, so its empty calories, but sheesh"
But with this gameplay?
"I mean, it'll have all the skins from the last few CODs right?"
Just wait until it actually comes out KEKW
I was excited for the 1990s iraq war theme of black ops 6 at least. This game has.. very little
so no exoskeleton in this one lol
thiicy minaj will arive
Give them time it will be stupid soon
lets check back in a month
No zac efron?
grounded like small or tiny skins
inb4 snoop dogg gets added for the 1056th time
cant wait to not play this game lol
"@Matimi0 Apex spiedrman, overwatch, CoD, borderland 4, mind eye"
I do not trust Activision claims that they cancelled big collaborations just to keep the grounded theme.
like the rappers in warzone
they have that Dawg
They actually toneddown the vault edition skins @Matimi0
they changed the deluxe edition skins
By Season 4 BO7 will have all kinds of funky skins again
they actually toned down the preorder skins
when call of duty gets peter griffin or garfield it will truly be over
"for early play its ""grounded"""
Sounds like shes gettings paid
good VAs get jobs
i think its good to hear her in more games
They actually toned down the vault edition skins. The picture in the store is just not updated @Matimi0
will you be playing mindseye soon mat? I'm sure everybody would love it
we need morgan freeman in more games
I love it when I notice it
Like troy baker or Matt mercer
Im just waiting for a Niki Minaj skin as soon as the game launches and people just running around Neon Pink
THis color grade on BO7 really give me older BO games vibes. But we in 2025 I need color!
Unless it's Laura Bailey. Every game should have Laura Bailey
I fought battlefield 6 was not coming out till next week but means it's downloading now in the background
radonWoop radonWoop radonWoop
I'd love Morgan Freeman as a VA in a game
"It's the same when actors have roles in every movie or tv shows, like Pedro Pascal the last few years"
matt are you getting battlefield 6 on steam or EA app does it matter?
"I didnt say its annoying, but i dont think she is amazing VA, she has only 1 voice"
What's been your favorite gun to use so far?
In Expedition 33 Maelle was always Shadowheart in my brain
gross
or yuri lowenthal
I just spent 2 days troubleshooting my new mic not working - windows privacy had mic unchecked pepeW
"@FreshPrince3223 yeah pretty much. cod vanguard was supposed to be ""grounded"" too they even went as far as saying no trophy system cuz its ww2 then after a couple seasons added a bunch of anime skins in a WWII game lepNOO lepNOO"
Its like troy baker he's in to much
hadowheart my beloved
i wonder if I'll only hear Maelle if I ever play BG3 KEKW
shadowheart*
every game Shadowhearts Voice actress has been involved in has been a Masterpiece @Matimi0
Shadowheart Mat's beloved
@Morgisboard Spider-Man is Sasuke to me LUL
Nathan Fillion will forever be Cayde and Buck for me
@corvus_55 THey gotta do something to pump up those earning reports LUL
That guy played the last call of duty
mat needs to sharpen those wall running skills
