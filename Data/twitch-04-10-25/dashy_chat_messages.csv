Bruce why you not playing?
@amroi fr he needs to see that shit
these pub kids just don’t want it enough is what I’m hearing
it was literal ai
I love COD that was my entire childhood but now it’s unplayable. BF4 and BF1 and in the future BF6 is much more advanced and fulfilling as a game
facts
felt bad for peanut when he played with them. he was just running around the map and couldn’t find any kills
the lobbies r clearly worse but idk how there 2 boxing w a full stack
explain Gwen online tho

for some reason scump and them got much easier lobbies yesterday vs today back to normal
thats why LATs kds were good
