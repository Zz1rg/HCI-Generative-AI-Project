"mandatory minimum sentences & the three strikes laws were so fucking heinous, but yeah they're mostly poor & disadvantaged people so no one cares about them"
"""11 years is unreasonable"" so why do i have to live for a decade of pouring money into healing all of the broken pieces inside my body my spine my brain my vascular damaged and 11 years sentence is too long??????"
kalief browder went to rykers for almost the same amount of time and he wasn't even charged with anything

@charliecowxox in the USA people are in jail for 10+ yrs on weed charges thats what she is talking about
"@lexplained, yea I won't be surprised if he end up in his administration. He checks all boxes."
Ugh
Someone in jail could do the funniest thing peepoSmile
it seems like everyone that runs those kind of organizations just seem to never really get In trouble I wonder why…
Rico was stupid they didn’t have enough prove for that
getting Diddy was a slam dunk but RICO charges were kind of silly.  especially in retrospect
Facing 25+ years originally to only get 4 is disgraceful om
"The Judge, Arun Subramanian has been on the federal bench for ~two years. He was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2023 in a 59-37 vote"

"man was an abuser, but not some kind of ""criminal overmind"""

RIP Kim Porter
being a father = free pass
ia a family man defense for rich people needs nerf
Literally just being a father
the bit of the video i saw seemed terribly hollow
the bar is in hell
What happened that made him change???? Being a good father doesn't mean its ok to do what ge did?
literally being present at all
GRUG MWORD protect men
cause the bar is so low for them
Tale as old as time
being a good father is the bare fucking minimum. it's what you're SUPPOSED to do
the bar is that low for men
MWORD mediocrity being praised again classic
Apparently it did since he refused to send him to jail for 11 years
a shield
he's doing the bare minimum
A shield
the bar is on the floor
Hey look! He got kids! This means he is a good person SURE SURE
it's bullshit
A load of shit from that judges mouth
a blank check to be shitty apparently
he held the baby so he’s all good
all fathers are shining beacons but daddy issues is a common trope because ????
I'm not sure good fathers kill the mother of their children.
Who wants to have kids to do crime
Christian patriarchy basically @carolinekwan
"Like if this was a mother, they would potray her as the devil"
a lot of the worst people in the world were husbands and fathers
there are also literally millions of other fathers for whom this is given zero consideration
It wouldn't count for shit if he was poor and unknown
so we can have a low sentence
no fr
"Doing the shit he did to me, says hes not a good father. If he was a good father he wouldnt be doing that shit."

"YEP same shit with charlie kirk lmfao ""he was a good father and husband......no dont look up the racist, transphobic, fascist, etc. shit he said"""
the only good things about his btw
poor men don't get to use that defense
@TehAdamBomb yup
him being a father makes what he did even worse
