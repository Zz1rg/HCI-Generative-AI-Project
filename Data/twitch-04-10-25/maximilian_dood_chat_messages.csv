@khalvollbart Nakayama kinda hinted at he wanted to talk about it. He made a random twitter post baiting people to ask about it
Capcom really fucking hates money
Cammy is hotter than Chun Li and Zangief is hotter than both
Crazy straight-forward for a Japanese dev.

Squeenix has talked how much they want to be able to share stuff twin Divisions cause it sux
"the profit a game make is for the own game grow, not usually used on other brands even if are under the same umbrela"
"as someone who works in marketing in the industry, they probably have department heads meet on some sort of cadence, but these decisions are 100% made in silos"
