As an expert Data Scientist specializing in NLP and content moderation, I have analyzed the provided labeled dataset. The analysis revealed that messages classified as offensive (label 1) frequently contain racial slurs (e.g., `niggaz`, `faggot`, `chinks`), explicit profanity (e.g., `fuck`, `bitch`, `wanker`), extreme insults (`fucktard`, `asshole`, `douchebag`), dehumanizing language, and calls for harm or suicide (`off yourself`).

Based on this learned pattern, I have classified the unlabeled messages.
