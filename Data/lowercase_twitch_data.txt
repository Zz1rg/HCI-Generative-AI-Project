as i‚Äôm literally smoking a bowl
how would you rate the prosecution? @carolinekwan
nothing beats our 34 felony president tho
@ivan_against_cuisine yes! there's no justice. the justice system is broken by capitalism
didn't biden pardon them?
any prison sentance
rich ppl get away scot free just a minimal slap on the wrist
it really is pay to win
war on drugs is fuckin bullshit yep
"there was a guy that just caught almost 20 years for burning a cop car, yet this piece of shit gets a slap on the wrist"
and sean combs will get out bc the jails are overcrowded with those poor people!!!!!!
well yea people who do weed are just so evil so 10-20 years but sean combs‚Ä¶. come on justice system
"mandatory minimum sentences & the three strikes laws were so fucking heinous, but yeah they're mostly poor & disadvantaged people so no one cares about them"
"""11 years is unreasonable"" so why do i have to live for a decade of pouring money into healing all of the broken pieces inside my body my spine my brain my vascular damaged and 11 years sentence is too long??????"
kalief browder went to rykers for almost the same amount of time and he wasn't even charged with anything
in china if you are caught smoking weed the punishment is max 15 days in prison and ~$250 like huuuuuuh @carolinekwan
rico was a dumb move
the rico charges were a mistep
"diddy will serve in low security, high value ""club fed"" type of jail for sure"
reynance just subscribed! ckwangivelove
everything got obfuscated
@xelovanx im sorry jmaria2l ckwangivelove
@charliecowxox in the usa people are in jail for 10+ yrs on weed charges thats what she is talking about
"@lexplained, yea i won't be surprised if he end up in his administration. he checks all boxes."
ugh
someone in jail could do the funniest thing peeposmile
it seems like everyone that runs those kind of organizations just seem to never really get in trouble i wonder why‚Ä¶
rico was stupid they didn‚Äôt have enough prove for that
getting diddy was a slam dunk but rico charges were kind of silly.  especially in retrospect
facing 25+ years originally to only get 4 is disgraceful om
"the judge, arun subramanian has been on the federal bench for ~two years. he was nominated to the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york by then-president joe biden in 2022 and confirmed by the u.s. senate in 2023 in a 59-37 vote"
bernarda is a cool name
puke
changed man how??!?!?
@ivan_against_cuisine ugh yeah if he gets his way. but he could also pardon him
"""just a family man"""
i wont watch that
"ughh i'm so over ""family man"" bullshit"
"always a ""family man"""
4 years is a slap in the face.... like he will be out in no time again
an 11 minute self glaze video
"some of the worst people in history were ""family men"""
yep
using his kids as props is so fucked up
pos
"man was an abuser, but not some kind of ""criminal overmind"""
his impact on the community as a serial abuser and sexual predator
rip kim porter
being a father = free pass
ia a family man defense for rich people needs nerf
literally just being a father
the bit of the video i saw seemed terribly hollow
the bar is in hell
what happened that made him change???? being a good father doesn't mean its ok to do what ge did?
literally being present at all
grug mword protect men
cause the bar is so low for them
tale as old as time
being a good father is the bare fucking minimum. it's what you're supposed to do
the bar is that low for men
mword mediocrity being praised again classic
apparently it did since he refused to send him to jail for 11 years
a shield
he's doing the bare minimum
a shield
the bar is on the floor
hey look! he got kids! this means he is a good person sure sure
it's bullshit
a load of shit from that judges mouth
a blank check to be shitty apparently
he held the baby so he‚Äôs all good
all fathers are shining beacons but daddy issues is a common trope because ????
i'm not sure good fathers kill the mother of their children.
who wants to have kids to do crime
christian patriarchy basically @carolinekwan
"like if this was a mother, they would potray her as the devil"
a lot of the worst people in the world were husbands and fathers
there are also literally millions of other fathers for whom this is given zero consideration
it wouldn't count for shit if he was poor and unknown
so we can have a low sentence
no fr
"doing the shit he did to me, says hes not a good father. if he was a good father he wouldnt be doing that shit."
pffttt didn't leave = good dad
literally fathers praised for not leaving
it should be completly seperate
mword getting the pass for doing the minimum
"elon musk.  the classic ""family man"" with 19 kids"
all you need to do is donate some sperm smh
"same, ck"
noted
@carolinekwan us mword get so much credit for literally no reason
"people assume because a dude has a child they have a ""nurturing"" side"
"yep same shit with charlie kirk lmfao ""he was a good father and husband......no dont look up the racist, transphobic, fascist, etc. shit he said"""
the only good things about his btw
poor men don't get to use that defense
@tehadambomb yup
him being a father makes what he did even worse
he‚Äôs a father so he didn‚Äôt commit a sex crime tf?
"@concussedkeeper hold on brother, what about divorce court? kkona"

miami server is cheese
@monicamonaka cod kids will shit on the game throughout the entire year and stop playing it 2 to 3 months before the new one drops
bf6 is smacking cod 100%
denver servers prolly chill af
have you tried overload? do u like it if so?
you should do a challenge video for your mods see how nasty they are at cod
are all the teams in texas now?
did u need to pre order to play the bf6 beta?
in apex people play on central to avoid east coast sweats
i wish it would tell you what server you are on
@monicamonaka thats steam brother no one is playing cod on steam xd'
how much do you think they will tweak the ttk tomorrow?
@monicamonaka open beta with closed beta
scump has beeeen the goat at pub stomping
scump is a pub stomping goat
crim ranked is way easier then my pub lobbies kids are vicious
he‚Äôs just different at pubs

what about nadeshot dropping 6 nukes
he‚Äôs just mr 99 iron

scump and formal's pov's look so simple and they never do too much
what‚Äôs your favorite gun so far in the beta
is everyone switching to the ps5 controller now?
most people are currently on gamepass
@dmiliz you really think he had no help ??
i miss hosts :')
yeah they don‚Äôt want a texas player to see they‚Äôre pinging 30+ to a shitty dallas server
why not play game?
!meta
nadeshot is a x games gold medalist

bro when you got 5 other cod ledgends on your team i bet its pretty easy to drop a nuke
i think they were getting hecz lobbies
nade was duo with sym
that was him and sym duo
am i fried or are u playing on paulys acc
not 6 stack
nade dropped 5 nukes in a duo
"nades playing in full parties of friends, him dropping nukes doesnt say anything about sbmm. thats just playing with good friends"
the whole map is open in a 6 stack
def
they constantly have uvs's aswell
lmao
don‚Äôt have anyone licking a wall
uav's
watch nade vod
i‚Äôm the guy rolling a backwood lol
bruce why you not playing?
@amroi fr he needs to see that shit
these pub kids just don‚Äôt want it enough is what i‚Äôm hearing
it was literal ai
i love cod that was my entire childhood but now it‚Äôs unplayable. bf4 and bf1 and in the future bf6 is much more advanced and fulfilling as a game
facts
felt bad for peanut when he played with them. he was just running around the map and couldn‚Äôt find any kills
the lobbies r clearly worse but idk how there 2 boxing w a full stack
explain gwen online tho
why are you on paulehxs account lol
unless ur playing like mc
for some reason scump and them got much easier lobbies yesterday vs today back to normal
thats why lats kds were good
you gonna watch the halo boys this weekend?
bro nade 100% used a vpn no way a guy like him gets normal 6 nuke
no pros r doing what anyone who plays w scump is doing

chat has mati ever worn white or any other color besides black?
"that is the ""screw this one guy in particular"" weapon"
"does this have ""omni-movement"""
@freshprince3223 blue
this is a game to keep us busy till bf6 :0
3 sicks in row.... you got a fever
:)
@matimi0 if this game add ladders i think it could compate with bf6
@spudbun yup
@plotarmour_ like navy blue kappa
so close to the sniper
clearly you've never checked out mat's onlygoths account
hawaiian shirt when?
chartreuse stream invoming
most my wardrobe is black and grey. i feel attacked
i think its so crazy people spend money on skins for these games because the skins go in the dumpster for the next game almost every year
charlie sheen bowling shirt vibes
@matimi0 i redeemed bowla :(
do the holograms do anything for shooting them besides waste ammo?
i only saw you in black always. imagine mati is actually dressed like harry styles irl
spending money on skins in a game is kinda cringe in general but at least for counter strike you can still use skins you bought 10 years ago
is that the voice actress for rampart on apex??
i swear to go symmatra voice actor is in every game now
god
i dont think call of duty has looked so meh
its because you dont slide matt
i was told 15 years ago i looked good in green. i should buy a green shirt
a i m a s s i s t
"""report player"""
so how goes beta night 2?
overwatch
was that... anjali bhimani?
@misterjab86 dude def was on mnk
xd
@misterjab86 scripts on pc kappa
i watched the first vod quite a bit today
does this game have dabbing and unicorn farts
all correct chat
"apex spidrman, overwatch, cod, borderland 4"
tomo farts
grounded until season 2
give it two months
for now
"what kills me is they spent so much time and money to make the most mid game of 2025. i mean, its cod, so its empty calories, but sheesh"
but with this gameplay?
"i mean, it'll have all the skins from the last few cods right?"
just wait until it actually comes out kekw
i was excited for the 1990s iraq war theme of black ops 6 at least. this game has.. very little
so no exoskeleton in this one lol
thiicy minaj will arive
give them time it will be stupid soon
lets check back in a month
no zac efron?
grounded like small or tiny skins
inb4 snoop dogg gets added for the 1056th time
cant wait to not play this game lol
"@matimi0 apex spiedrman, overwatch, cod, borderland 4, mind eye"
i do not trust activision claims that they cancelled big collaborations just to keep the grounded theme.
like the rappers in warzone
they have that dawg
they actually toneddown the vault edition skins @matimi0
they changed the deluxe edition skins
by season 4 bo7 will have all kinds of funky skins again
they actually toned down the preorder skins
when call of duty gets peter griffin or garfield it will truly be over
"for early play its ""grounded"""
sounds like shes gettings paid
good vas get jobs
i think its good to hear her in more games
they actually toned down the vault edition skins. the picture in the store is just not updated @matimi0
will you be playing mindseye soon mat? i'm sure everybody would love it
we need morgan freeman in more games
i love it when i notice it
like troy baker or matt mercer
im just waiting for a niki minaj skin as soon as the game launches and people just running around neon pink
this color grade on bo7 really give me older bo games vibes. but we in 2025 i need color!
unless it's laura bailey. every game should have laura bailey
i fought battlefield 6 was not coming out till next week but means it's downloading now in the background
radonwoop radonwoop radonwoop
i'd love morgan freeman as a va in a game
"it's the same when actors have roles in every movie or tv shows, like pedro pascal the last few years"
matt are you getting battlefield 6 on steam or ea app does it matter?
"i didnt say its annoying, but i dont think she is amazing va, she has only 1 voice"
what's been your favorite gun to use so far?
in expedition 33 maelle was always shadowheart in my brain
gross
or yuri lowenthal
i just spent 2 days troubleshooting my new mic not working - windows privacy had mic unchecked pepew
"@freshprince3223 yeah pretty much. cod vanguard was supposed to be ""grounded"" too they even went as far as saying no trophy system cuz its ww2 then after a couple seasons added a bunch of anime skins in a wwii game lepnoo lepnoo"
its like troy baker he's in to much
hadowheart my beloved
i wonder if i'll only hear maelle if i ever play bg3 kekw
shadowheart*
every game shadowhearts voice actress has been involved in has been a masterpiece @matimi0
shadowheart mat's beloved
@morgisboard spider-man is sasuke to me lul
nathan fillion will forever be cayde and buck for me
@corvus_55 they gotta do something to pump up those earning reports lul
that guy played the last call of duty
mat needs to sharpen those wall running skills
"surprised they actually responded, but always good to see"
what a shame
exactly correct....different divisions.
thats a nice shirt max
they were at tgs and found out lol
"but this is about streaming that event for global audience, so you cant just excuse it for a global audience that do watch this"

@khalvollbart nakayama kinda hinted at he wanted to talk about it. he made a random twitter post baiting people to ask about it
capcom really fucking hates money
cammy is hotter than chun li and zangief is hotter than both
crazy straight-forward for a japanese dev.
"i'll admit, i thought they were all in the same building and communicating with one another"
they're 1 person

they're going to put money where the money is coming from
no that just means even more dlc in the next mh
"@mayday_believes ah gotcha i missed that, thanks for the clarification"
lets all share code!
yeah thats not how it works
a lot of folks don't really know how the game industry business works lul
people forget how massive these companies are
wowowo its not making lol money
people making things up in their head lul
umbrella? doodwut
umbrella????
well technically you can share info
umbrella... monkas
capcom don't touch me there...
well ed boon is a baddass... glitchnrg
even the soul caibur team once explained they're totally separate from the tekken team..
@machriphi i think the main issue is that the japanese fans will buy this 100% they love street fighter like crazy

yoooo whats up chat!? doodbro doodshake doodshake doodgg doodgg
you gotta set up a knowledge transfer meeting for that
squeenix has talked how much they want to be able to share stuff twin divisions cause it sux
"the profit a game make is for the own game grow, not usually used on other brands even if are under the same umbrela"
"as someone who works in marketing in the industry, they probably have department heads meet on some sort of cadence, but these decisions are 100% made in silos"
@vzlaboi interesting doodnote
isnt that what they did to sf6? pull ppl to go work on mh and other projects? @maximilian_dood so so i thought
bioware has tried that multiple times to horrible results
and this ppv addition is hurting the actual product.

"@khalvollbart yeah nakayama's first post is like ""here's the art i wanted to use. crazy i cant because i have no control over the esports team. we are separate"" lmao"
there's a reason why we had to fight for rollback

people really thinking garen is good into nasus lmao me i find this mu free lp on nasus
cancel e with an auto and r ur so skilled
bwipo my goat - hows it
why do garens always go ignite? is he that good of an early brawler?
@taekwonbr lets see
@idlefarmer007 this nasus is gonna lose i can tell he is bad by his runes alone
@highelo_s1 yes level 2 good kill pressure
@highelo_s1 to gap close with nimbus clock
good synergy with his ult
"@highelo_s1 he has infinite sustain and doesnt spend mana, so he can always stay a little longer in lane"
gg top is over
nasus gonna die level 2 xd
@idlefarmer007 oh word thank you
bullying the dog dinodance
d cane
how do u make it look so ez
@itsmario6969 ahh that makes sense
nasus already regretting queuing up
garen level 2 spike with ignite so nasty
"@dantiltas so just more frequent kill pressure over time, wouldnt need tp as often? makes sense"
"garen just walks in front of his tower, when dog want to enter garen just e and win lane"
thanks yall
!elo
balanced
hey @bwipolol hope you‚Äôre doing well tonight!
bwipo fisting him
most nasus players are clueless on how to play a scaling god lmao

"considering that the game stops getting progressively harder, and you're already capped, you could just go afk with no probs."

@mickeys_bones detune7 see you in a bit
new pararnormal detour tumbler and mug just dropped and all paranormal detour merch has been unvalted and is available this week - get in! https://shop.paranormaldetour.com
@khaoticduck probably other police/dispatch employees in the background
"rest easy, bones detunepl"
"i wanna say that this is not appalachia. it's in nc, but it's not mountainous and it's right on the coast"
it does
that was me yesterday with my dogs detuneyesyes
appalachia includes north carolina
uhhh i think so?
it does
"they say the name of the county at the beginning, it might not be in the mountains tbf"
"appalachia does touch nc, but this is the coastal side"
oh its on the coast area so not near mountains
appalachia is on the west part of the state! but we have very mountains and also very flat beaches
nc 210 is costal north carolina not in the mountains
@t03xb3ans sounds to soft
theyre saying this county is near the coast not the mountains
"also as someone who almost worked as a police dispatcher, yall need to learn hoe to give instructions. some of the example calls i had to listen too/log info were wild"
thunk
goooot it
this location is by the film location of the 1st conjuring house south east
i hear the whisper too
this guy has immaculate comms
this area is very swampy and has gators
its near the coast
so yeah probably
@ollieandroe yeah knowing how to concisely give comms is so important
"this area has a lot of straight roads and swampy, yeah"
it's a subtropical climate where this is located
@ollieandroe i would immediately forget how to speak probably lol
"yes theres some including my favorite named swamp ""the great dismal swamp"""
d: it was a gator that can jump
oh i know... a gator jumped in the back of his truck (hehe)
maybe crane then?
"@mag_guanag i love that place, lots of unique plants there"
"yeah they do, i was a 911 dispatcher for a very brief moment of time"
okay that was loud
this poor dispatcher
@catdaddyneff tbf i've had to call 911 and give comms before so i also just know what they need detuneyesyes i hope nobody has too tho cos it's definitely nerve wracking
carolina case files interviewed him and the police officer. i‚Äôve never been more invested.
i would never omg
the genuine panic in his voice is terrifying
yes
i thought that was his blinker thing
ew
i think that was it going over the top
omg ew
"she's trying to figure out if it's animal/vegetable/mineral, he's trying not to get eaten by a random monster"
eww

honestly if it was a deer it could've been trying to escape cause it was also in panic

could it be when there was those escaped lab monkeys?
standing and walking away tho
