How is the update of Val so far?
did you like the new vandal
hi
@intruders_ Better for spams while being mostly the same as vandal for damage
@tenz what do you think would be different for SEN if you never left
"gotcha, thank you"
"@Vitalytoly i dont think it would be a bad look. it could revive the general public competitiveness. The game has been out for 5 years now, and not a single change to ranked rewards or anthing to revive ranked and give people something to play for"

"@Ilvc4s his signature was fine, his problem is that he has little to no stopping power as a sentinel and his flank watch is mediocre at best. but now that all the sentinels got fucked and util is more sparse his gameplan is actually much more impactful"

@intruders_ alot more util is strategically used and close range gunfights are more common and phantom just better for spraying thru util
ok
"@oFakeee agree to disagree. if people prefer a third party app over your own system i think its a bad look. they're doing ranked rewards next year so we're getting that finally at least, but yeah riot should've done way more with the game than they have. CS and Dota 2 is like a game within a game even when you're not playing, theres so much to explore and do inside the game other than just playing"
"@Quikanims yeah that definitely is a big reason hes better now, his signature was fine the way people played it wasnt ideal"
ew tf
chat can you help me one of youtube chanel use tenz name and scamming people
