"Niiiiiiice, glad to see the crew playing this again. Such a great looking game."
bf6 on masx settings is no joke
hows the optimization ?
devs should let modders polish their games bc they obv know what they are doing
the biggest question is are they gonna use UNITY again?
@Rumblecrush spt is closer to what they actually wanted YEP
sadge u have to play on low settings
"@Protomateria tarkov was also supposed to have an open world between all the zones, I wouldnt hold my breath"
i feel like shroud would do a really good ian malcolm impression
"@KingGhum I see, cheers"
@xfidd amazing
arc will be my main game until gta6
@nahhurgoood Depends on the map be usually 20-25ish
is it true this game wont be wiping at all?
"Tarkov aint going anywhere until it gets real competition, people still play OSRS and it looks like dog shit"
what’s the consensus on this fame?
"@turntablist_mk2 not everyone has weekends off, it would be bad because it would alienate people just by it's availability game devs are all about either fully capturing a niche market or casting as wide a net as possible and neither strat wants to make enemies of the consumer base"
Tarkov is supposed to have post launch DLC too
"@userename If they have braincells, no"
@nahhurgoood unknown cause if pplayers die early new can spawn in. so id say 20+
it’s gotta have beavis and butthead skins though
this map seem small already after playing a few hours
