My Cards are looking good against Miami  rn
Solo is sweaty as hell

ratty asf
SOLO VS SOLO ?
yes
@Faufar yuh
for me solo has seemed so much easier then sqauds
"@Faufar i ran into a few duos, but it seems like they try to match"
solos is easy
ratty but a lot of peeps didnt wanna fight lol
what game isnâ€™t sweaty nowadays?
Solo is terrible... There's no way to take out squads unless they literally afk
"@MightyTightieBot Yes, which you can build crafting stations in and other stuff. Very limited in this stress test though."
The AI does pretty well hunting out rats in the open
Got downed but not eliminated in my elevator almost every round of solos tonight.
